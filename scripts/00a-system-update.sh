# ── Session staleness guard (issue #627) ───────────────────────────────────
# A rolling upgrade that replaces kwin/plasma-workspace/libplasma/qt6-base/
# qt6-declarative pulls the libraries out from under the session that is already
# running: the live KWin/Plasma keeps the old ones in memory until the session
# ends, while 08-build-shell.sh compiles the Caelestia plugin against the new
# headers on disk and 06-services.sh loads the KWin bridge into that same old
# process. That is the partial-upgrade state Arch warns about, and it shows up
# later as Wayland protocol/ABI errors that look like a broken build rather than
# a stale session.
#
# Identity of the running KWin: its PID and start time in clock ticks. Both
# change when the session is restarted, which is the only thing that makes a
# stale-session verdict stop applying. No running KWin (a TTY install, another
# desktop) means there is no session to invalidate, so the guard stands down.
