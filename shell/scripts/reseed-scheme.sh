# Re-derives the Caelestia scheme from the wallpaper that is on screen.
#
# The CLI derives dynamic colours from the wallpaper it was last told about
# (`caelestia wallpaper -f`). path.txt is written directly by the deploy script
# and by the wallpaper picker's still-frame path, so the CLI can be left without
# a wallpaper; `caelestia scheme set -n dynamic` then writes nothing at all, the
# palette stays on the CLI's built-in default, and the shell pushes that default
# into kde-material-you-colors, which is why the whole desktop can come back on
# the wrong colours until something re-derives.
#
# Run at shell start so a session always ends up on the wallpaper it is showing.
# A scheme the user picked is left alone.
