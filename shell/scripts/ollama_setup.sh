#

# where there is no terminal to answer a prompt, so the model list arrives as an
# argument instead of a menu (issues #654, #656).

# Installing and starting the daemon needs root. The caller elevates (pkexec or
# sudo); when this runs unprivileged from a terminal, each command goes through
# sudo instead, which is the one path that can prompt on a TTY.
#
# Strict mode, as required of everything that drives the installer:
# pipefail is the one that changes behaviour here. The Ollama installer is
# fetched with `curl | sh`, and without it a failed download pipes nothing into
# a shell that exits 0 quite happily. The script would then carry on to enable a
# service for a package that was never installed, and die there instead, with an
# error pointing at the wrong step.
set -euo pipefail

# pkexec hands the script a minimal PATH without /usr/local/bin, which is where
# the Ollama installer drops the binary - `ollama pull` below would then not be
# found even though the install just succeeded.
